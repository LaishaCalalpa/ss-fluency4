/* Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every k characters counting from the start 
of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than k but greater than or equal 
to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.

Example:
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
